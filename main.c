/*
 * This program is to calculate the average of the number that the user introduces so long as it is not a 0.
 * When the user introduces a 0, the program will stop asking for numbers and calculate the average.
 * The average is simplye the sum of all the terms divided by the number of terms that participated on the addition.
 *
 * Problem Analysis.
 * Problem: Write a program which allows us to calculate the average of all the numbers that the user introduces. The
 * user will keep on introducing numbers as long as that number isn't 0.
 * Inputs: Numbers that the user gives us.
 * Calculations: The sum of all the numbers introduced by the user divided by the number of terms that he introduced.
 * Outputs: Average of all the numbers introduced.
 *
 * Algorithm.
 * 1 Begin
 * 2 Ask the user for a number
 * 3 If the number != 0 , ask for another number
 * 4 If the number == 0, calculate the average
 * 5 Display the average
 * 6 End
